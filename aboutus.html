    <p id="bio1">Hi, we're Nadean, Pawandeep, Annika, and Nisha. We're from the Girls Who Code program at Synchrony Financial in Chicago.
      We created this project to help users become more environmentally active in an interactive way. We hope our network helps
      bring awareness to simple ways that people can reduce their carbon footprint and waste.

    <h2>NADEAN GHOULEH</h2>
    <p class="left">Hey it's Nadean, I am currently a junior at Universal school. I honestly joined Girls Who Code to try something new and meet new people, which I did. The best part about the program was interacting with everyone. Some activities I enjoy are engaging in outdoor activities, spending time with family and friends, drawing, and reading. I appreciate everyone who encouraged me to get involved with Girls Who Code, it was truly a great experience. </p>
