  <h1>About Our Team</h1>
  <img style="width:304px;height:228px;"></img>
  <p>Hi, we're Nadean, Pawandeep, Annika, and Nisha. We're from the Girls Who Code program at Synchrony Financial in Chicago.
    We created this project to help users become more environmentally active in an interactive way. We hope our network helps
    bring awareness to simple ways that people can reduce their carbon footprint and waste.
